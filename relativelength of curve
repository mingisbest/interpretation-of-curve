%calculate the relative length of one curve
%p is 3D vector
%length is the total length of one curveï¼Œ while straight length is the direct length between two points located on the endpoints of curve
%The first tortuosity descriptor that we used was relative length (RL), which is defined by the following formula: l/lc

function RL = relativelength(p)
px = p(:,1);py = p(:,2);pz = p(:,3);
dx = (px(1:end-1)-px(2:end)).^2;
dy = (py(1:end-1)-py(2:end)).^2;
dz = (pz(1:end-1)-pz(2:end)).^2;
D = [dx,dy,dz];
D2 = sqrt(sum(D,2));
Length = sum(D2);
px1 = p(1,1);py1 = p(1,2);pz1 = p(1,3);
px2 = p(end,1);py2 = p(end,2);pz2 = p(end,3);
straightlength = norm(px2-px1);

RL = straightlength/Length
